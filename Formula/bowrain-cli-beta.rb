  conflicts_with "bowrain-cli", because: "both install the bowrain plugin"

  # Plugin layout: kapi-bowrain binary + manifest.json, under a single `bowrain/`
  # top-level directory. Homebrew chdirs into that directory before `install`
  # runs, so the staged tree is flat — glob "*", not "bowrain/*" (which matches
  # nothing and installs an empty array). Install the whole tree under the keg's
  # own share/kapi/plugins/bowrain; Homebrew then links it to
  # HOMEBREW_PREFIX/share/kapi/plugins/bowrain, the shared kapi plugins root
  # `kapi` discovers. Installing into the keg (rather than symlinking into
  # HOMEBREW_PREFIX, which the install sandbox denies with EPERM because that
  # path belongs to another formula) keeps the install sandbox-safe and lets
  # `brew uninstall` clean up.
